url,(2014) Generation of multipartite spin entanglement from multimode squeezed states,"N. Sridhar, O.Pfister","We investigate the systematic use of Schwinger representation, by virtue of which two boson fields are equivalent to an effective spin, for casting multimode squeezed states into multipartite spin entangled states. The motivation for this endeavor is the following established fact: finitely squeezed two-mode entangled states can be recast into maximally entangled bipartite spin states, irrespective of their level of squeezing (in the lossless case). This work explores the generalization of this interesting property to multipartite entanglement. While we found that the generalization from multipartite Gaussian entanglement to multipartite spin entanglement is not straightforward, there are nonetheless interesting features and entangled states to be found. Here we study a few CV entangled states already realized experimentally, and show that some of them correspond to multipartite spin entangled states.",1
